# Instructions
Please find relevant instructions about the files and the visualizations below.
**IMPORTANT!** Sometimes the KNN map (GitHub's fault) doesn't render with the proper colors the dots in the map, therefore if this happens please try to ***reload the page***.

## Web Page with visualizations
The link to the web page with the D3 visualizations is here: https://oikonang.github.io/social_data_visualization/Assignment_2/

## Jupyter Notebook
Please find inside this folder also the Jupyter Notebook containing the solution to the KNN exercise from Week 5, including also the creation of the files needed for the D3 visualizations.

## Bl.ocks
We also rendered the single visualizations with bl.ocks.org:
