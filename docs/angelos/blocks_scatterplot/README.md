# San Francisco crime per District

## Getting Started

*This scatterplot is a representation of the change in number of crimes in SanFrancisco over the years. It seems that if we check the correlation in number of crimes between two different crime categories, and then swipe throught the years we can observe weather the SFPD is doing a good job or not by checking how closer the points in the scatterplot come to the beginning of the axes(0,0). The size of the points relate to the total number of crimes in 2003 and 2015 respectively.*
